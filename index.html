                        <br>Son of Sigurd Syr, one of the kings of the Kingdom of Ringerike in Norway, Harald lives
                        by day around 1015.
                        <br>Better known as Harald Hardrada, he is often considered to be the last king of the
                        Viking era.
                        <br>Following a revolt, he first went into exile in Kiev's Rus', then to Constantinople
                        where he became head of the Varangian guard.
                        <br>Around 1045, he returned to Norway and acquired the title of King of Norway.
                        <br>His last battle was on September 25, 1066 at Stamford Bridge near York, in the Saxon
                        kingdom.
                        <br>He was a great genius of war whose feats of arms will inspire many of today's
                        historical reconstructions.

            The initial goal of this project is to show the know-how I acquired during the realization of this project.
            But also highlight
            two heroes of the Viking age in Scandinavia, history will have retained the multiple battles they fought.
            The
            hero fights inspire me to the daily and I like to make a connection that they led and my professional
            reconversion,
            indeed, it is in both cases a fights of each moment, each stage is a new test that I have so far,
            successful!
